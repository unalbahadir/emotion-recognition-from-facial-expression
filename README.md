A machine learning project, recognizing real-time emotions from facial expressions by building a convolutional neural network model (using deep learning library of Python, Keras) which is designed according to results of automated experiments that train models with FER2013 dataset (where emotions are classified into seven emotional states) for various combinations of layer numbers and their filter numbers. Project is implemented as a web app with Flask. It activates the webcam and it detects faces with OpenCV, thus it displays real-time emotional states of people on top of their heads by applying the model.
